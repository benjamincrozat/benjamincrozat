Hello, there! 👋🏻

I'm a full-stack web developer from the South of France. ☀️

I [blog](https://benjamincrozat.com) and [tweet](https://twitter.com/benjamincrozat) about web development.

I also [teach SEO](https://bloggingwithlaravel.com) to Laravel developers.

In my free time, I love to travel and shoot the [best possible landscapes](https://www.instagram.com/benjamincrozat/).
