Hello, there! 👋🏻

I'm a full-stack web developer from the South of France. ☀️  
I mostly work as a freelancer with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

I made [Larabiz](https://larabiz.fr), a project aimed toward French Laravel web developers looking for new opportunities. Subscribe to the [newsletter](https://larabiz.fr/newsletter) if you're interested! It's sent every Monday.

In my free time, I love to travel and shoot the best possible landscapes. 📷
