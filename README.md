Hello, there! 👋🏻

I'm a full-stack web developer with 10+ years of experience from the South of France. ☀️

- I run [Nobinge](https://nobinge.ai), a SaaS to summarize and chat with YouTube videos, webpages, and PDFs. [API access](https://nobinge.ai/api) is available for developers.
- [My blog](https://benjamincrozat.com) is another of my side hustles.
- I managed to grow it to tens of thousands monthly visitors ([advertising space](https://benjamincrozat.com/media-kit) is available).
- I [post on 𝕏](https://twitter.com/benjamincrozat) to more than 6,400 followers.
