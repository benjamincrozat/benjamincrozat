Hello, there! 👋🏻

I'm a full-stack web developer from the South of France. ☀️

I [blog](https://benjamincrozat.com) and [tweet](https://twitter.com/benjamincrozat) about web development.

I built [Smousss](https://smousss.com), a tool for Laravel developers to delegate repetitive work to GPT-4. 🤖

I also [teach SEO](https://bloggingwithlaravel.com) to Laravel developers. 📈

In my free time, I love to travel and shoot the [best possible landscapes](https://www.instagram.com/benjamincrozat/). 📷
