I'm a full stack web developer from the South of France. I mostly work as a freelancer with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). I also do a bit of Apple platforms development as a hobby.  
On my free time, I love to travel and shoot the best possible landscapes photographs. 📷 You can see them here: https://www.instagram.com/benjamincrozat/
